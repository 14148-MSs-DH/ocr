The Empiricists accepted the challenge laid down by Plato and Aristotle and undertook
to show that experience was entirely sufficient to give rise to an art by itself without the aid
of reason in the special sense in which it refers to a faculty whose distinctive characteristic is
the ability to grasp truths not accessible to observation. Rationalism, on the other hand, was
not a single school, but a tendency common to medical thinkers of diverse views belonging
to different schools who were united only by the conviction that a true art must go beyond
experience and grasp the hidden natures and causes of things by means of reason.
The commemorative sign was, it seems, the favored tool of the Empiricists; the indicative
sign that of the rationalists. Both seem to have their home in the practice of an art rather than
the original process of constituting one. Commemorative signs point to evident events and
conditions with which they have been conjoined in past experience. In the sphere of medicine,
indicative signs reveal the hidden, pathological conditions underlying the patient's symptoms,
which in turn indicate the appropriate therapy. To be sure, indicative signs could perhaps be
viewed as playing a double role, as the means by which theory is applied to particular cases in
practice and as the means by which elements in the theory are inferred from evident observa-
tion in the first place, which would make for closer fit with Sextus' framework. There is little
evidence for this, however.
Let me mention two more important oddities. If there was a position that does meet the
expectations created by Sextus' framework, it would seem to be that of Epicurus and his fol-
lowers, who make explicit appeals to signs as the basis of their theories about non-evident
matters in the realm of natural philosophy, atoms, and the motions of distant heavenly bodies,
for instance. But though he mentions Epicurus a couple of times in passing, Sextus has nothing
substantive to say about Epicurean views (Adversus mathematicos 8.177, 185).
On the other hand, he devotes much attention to the Stoics, whose definition of the sign
I cited above. But this turns out to be perhaps the most puzzling thing of all in Sextus' treat-
ment of signs. He has, as we have seen, no complaint against the commemorative sign and
promises to direct his fire exclusively on indicative signification. The Stoic theory against
which he argues should then be a theory of indicative signification, or at least have its primary
application to indicative signs whether the Stoics used this terminology or not. And indeed the
text of Sextus plainly states that the Stoic definition is merely an alternative characterization
of the indicative sign (Outlines of Pyrrhonism 2.102). So awkward is the placement of this
assertion, and so poorly does it fit its context, however, that scholars, including the editor of
the standard edition, have rejected it as an interpolation. If this is right, as there is good reason
to believe that it is, what we have is an ill-fated effort to paper over a gap between Sextus'
avowed purpose to combat the indicative sign and the prominence he gives to the case against
a Stoic theory whose relation to indicative signs is the opposite of clear.
Indeed, such evidence as we have points to a closer affinity with empirical reasoning of
the kind that falls under the head of commemorative signification. Unlike the Empiricists,
the Stoics did not question the possibility of grasping the hidden natures of things or reject
causal explanations based on them. Indeed Sextus also preserves a Stoic theory of demonstra-
tion whose chief application appears to have been causal explanation in natural philosophy,
which is accorded its own discussion by Sextus (Outlines of Pyrrhonism 2.134-92; Adversus
