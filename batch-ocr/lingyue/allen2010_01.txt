GREEK PHILOSOPHIY AND SIGNS

Our term ``sign'' comes, of course, straight from the Latin signum, which in turn renders
the Greek opiov, whose range of uses it tracks pretty closely. Not only the term, but the
idea or complex of ideas for which it stands are an inheritance from Greco-Roman antiquity.
If in this area as in so many others the Romans were indebted to the Greeks, here as elsewhere
the Hellenic world was indebted to the ancient Near Eastern civilizations that preceded and
coincided with it. The issues raised by these debts lie outside the scope of this essay, the aim
of which is twofold. I want to sketch, in very rough outline, some of the main developments
in ancient Greek thinking about signs. To that end, I shall be exploring some of the distinc-
tions in which that thought is enshrined. But I also want to look at some corners of ancient
Greek thought about this subject that are not captured, or at any rate are accommodated only
with some strain, by the framework to which these distinctions belong. In the way of even the
best and most illuminating efforts to distinguish and classify, these distinctions do not cover
all cases equally well, and as often happens, it is the cases that impose the most strain on, a
system or framework that are in some ways the most interesting.
As a first approximation, we might say that a sign is something that has or conveys mean-
ing. This proposal is on the right lines, but baldly stated it has the potential to mislead. Talk
of ``meaning'' inevitably brings to mind words, statements, and the like - in a word, language
or language-like communication devices such as coded messages or signals.
It is not that we do not find the ancient term ``sign'' and the verb ``signify'' employed in
this way. This use is well and amply attested. Plato's Cratylus was the most sustained and
influential contribution to the long-running ancient debate about whether word-meaning is
simply a matter of convention or there is, rather, a natural standard of correctness that gov-
erns the relation between words and their meanings so that some words are better suited by
nature to mean certain things than others. The naturalist theory expounded and subjected to
critical examination by Socrates in the dialogue envisages original legislators of names who
are said to have fashioned ``a sign and a name for each existing thing'' (427c). In the passage
in Plato's Sophist where for the first time the function of a name, viz. to pick out or refer to
an object, is distinguished from that of a statement, wherein a predicate is joined to the name
to assert something of the object designated by the name, the words composing the statement
are described as ``signs consisting in speech'' (262d). Aristotle calls words ``signs'' in his
discussion of the statements composed out of them in the De interpretatione (16al6, b7, 10).
Stoic dialectic, which corresponds roughly to our discipline of logic but also covers much
of the ground covered by grammar and theory of meaning, Was concerned both with things
