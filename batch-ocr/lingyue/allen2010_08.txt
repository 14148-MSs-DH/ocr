The fact that natural signs are the concern of artificial divination while natural divina-
tion is occupied with what look rather like bearers of non-natural meaning is perhaps only a
superficial paradox. Yet the distinctions with which we began are bound to take on a different
look in the context of a view like the Stoics', according to which the universe is governed
down to the last detail by a providential deity whose benevolence extends to the provision of
signs for us to read. The Stoics maintained that the world was so created at the beginning that
certain signs run ahead of certain things (De divinatione 1.118, cf. 35). At the very least, the
clean division between natural signs and bearers of natural meaning, which do not depend on
intention for their significance, on the one hand, and given signs or bearers of non-natural
meaning, on the other, which signify as a result of an intention to signify that must be grasped
for this purpose to be effected, will not look quite the same.
One way to approach this point sets out from a familiar problem: How can experience of
conjunctions among objects or events between which reason cannot discern any other relations
furnish a ground or reason for inferring one from the other? One response, most famously as-
sociated with David Hume, is to deny that it can and insist that the observation of conjunctions
does not put us in possession grounds for inferences properly so called, but rather gives rise
to customs or habits by which practice is governed in the absence of reason. It is noteworthy
that there was a prominent strand of radical anti-rationalism among the medical Empiricists,
some of whom insisted that they were not engaged in the business of reasoning at all, but
were instead guided by dispositions, implanted by experience, to be reminded of one thing by
the perception of another with which it had been conjoined in past observation. Others were
willing to speak of reasoning, but insisted that the kind of reasoning that they employed was
of an ordinary, everyday sort restricted to the phenomena, which they called epilogismos in
order to distinguish it from reason of the objectionable rationalist kind, which they called
analogismos. As we have seen, however, conspicuous correlations among events between
which reason can discern no connection were, according to the Stoics, deliberately contrived
for the benefit of humankind by god.
No doubt it is possible to be guided by these signs without being aware of or paying
heed to the divine intention of which they are the expression. But one may also, and I take it
the Stoic diviner will, go further and view divinatory signs as a system of divinely instituted
signals, with the result that the faith he reposes in the signs that he studies will not be a mat-
ter of either rationally groundless custom, on the one hand, or conviction grounded in purely
empirical reasoning - supposing there is such a thing -, on the other, but more like the trust
one places in the testimony of an unimpeachable authority. Long observation and experience
will for him be a source of clues about what the gods mean to tell us, rather than being viewed
simply as the source of grounds to be exploited in empirical reasoning or the causal basis for
mental habits of association.
Or rather, they will be this in addition to being that. The Stoics were far from repudiating
the idea of the empirical. We have seen Chrysippus appealing to it. It is plain that even in
the art of divination as the Stoics conceived it there will be an empirical aspect or dimension
to what is known in the sphere of artificial divination and an empirical level to the diviner's
understanding of it. This is implied by the comparison between divination and less exalted
arts. The concern with divinely sent signs as such seems to be distinctive of the diviner's art
