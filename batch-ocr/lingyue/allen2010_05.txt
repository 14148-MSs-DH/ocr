GREEK PHILOSOPHY AND SIGNS
According to the view in question, however, no amount of experience by itself is suf-
ficient to uncover the underlying natures of things because of which they behave as they are
observed to do; these natures are the causes in terms of which genuine explanations must be
framed, and they can be revealed, if at all, only by the insights of a special faculty of reason.
Plato, Aristotle and those who follow them on this point insist that a real art (v) and real
knowledge (ctotr) must go beyond experience to grasp the causes with the aid of reason
conceived in this special way. The other distinction with which we shall be chiefly concerned
is that between reason and experience.
These facts need to be kept in view as we turn to what is far and away the most extensive
discussion of signs in surviving ancient Greek philosophical literature, that found in Sextus
Empiricus, who was a Pyrrhonian Sceptic active, probably, in late second century A.D. His
task as a sceptic was to call into question pretensions to knowledge in each department of
philosophy. To this end, he adopts a framework dividing philosophy into parts, within which
he expounds in enormous and enormously valuable detail the views of his dogmatic opponents
before undertaking to refute them. He tackles epistemology first (which belongs to the logical
division of philosophy as the ancient Greeks conceived it), and he treats as common ground
a division of labor between the criterion, on the one hand, and signs and proofs on the other
(Adversus mathematicos 7.24-26, cf. 396; 8.140, 319; Outlines of Pyrrhonism 2.96).
Knowledge of evident matters is the province of the criterion according to the framework
that he adopts, and the truths won with its aid are in turn the basis of inferences by signs or
demonstrations that promise to extend knowledge to the realm of the non-evident. It is plain
that in setting up this framework Sextus does not distinguish between the function of signs
and that of demonstrations and that he assigns to both an elevated part in the formation of
natural philosophical theory.
The views that Sextus goes on to present and examine when he turns to signs do not really
fulfill the corresponding expectation, however, and this is only the first in a series of peculiari-
ties in his account. His discussion is framed in terms of a distinction between commemora-
tive and indicative signs, only the former of which, he says, are acceptable to the Pyrrhonists
(Outlines of Pyrrhonism 2.200-01; cf. Adversus mathematicos 8.154).
A commemorative sign is: ``that which, having been evidently co-observed with the
signified, together with its occurrence when the signified matter is non-evident, leads
us into a recollection of what was co-observed with it but is now not manifest.''
An indicative sign is: ``that which has not been evidently co-observed with the signi-
fied, but from its own nature and constitution signifies that of which it is a sign.''
Though this distinction is philosophical in the sense of being concerned with episte-
mological issues of completely general import, there are good reasons to believe that it was
not the creation of professional philosophers, but rather had its origin in the context of the
long-running debate between the self-styled Empirical school of medicine, which arose in the
mid-third century B.C., and its opponents, the medical rationalists.
