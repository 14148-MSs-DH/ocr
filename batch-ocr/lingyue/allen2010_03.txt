GREEK PHILOSOPHY AND SIGNS
it is light follows from the fact that is it day, the latter can hardly be a sign of the former.
One cannot know that it is day without, at the same time, knowing that it is light. Compare
the familiar examples cited earlier: smoke as a sign of fire, tracks as the sign of an animal's
passage, and the like. Knowledge of the sign is, so to speak, given to us directly, while that
of which it is a sign comes to be known through the sign.
The ancient Greek vipto and Latin evidentia mean the quality of being evident or
manifest, which I believe remains the dominant sense of ``evidence'' in modern European
languages apart from English. To serve as evidence for or of a conclusion, a sign must exhibit
evidence in this sense in addition to furnishing grounds for a conclusion, either absolutely or
by comparison with the conclusion for which it is evidence, which fact seems to lie behind
the sense of the term meaning evidence for a conclusion.
There is another pervasive, if not completely ubiquitous, feature of the ancient Greek
philosophical thought about signs that calls for comment. Inference from signs often, though
not always, makes up the inferior side of a contrast with forms of inference, sometimes called
``demonstrations'' (d6doettg), that are, in one way or another, superior to it. The version of
this contrast that we find in Aristotle, where for the most part it is implicit, is representative.
According to him, one has knowledge, at least in the strict and favored sense, not when one
has a true belief and is justified in holding it - the condition that we tend to mean when we
speak of knowledge and the focus of most contemporary epistemology - but rather when, in
addition, one understands why matters are as one knows them to be, that is, grasps the cause
or explanation for their being so. This is knowing the because as opposed to knowing (merely)
the that, as Aristotle often puts it, and it is this condition that deserves above all to be called
knowledge in his view.
The first principles of a science, in terms of which everything in the domain of that science
is to be explained, are themselves self-explanatory, not by being self-evident, but in the sense
that, while other things are explained and understood by reference to them, they are not un-
derstood or explained by reference to other more fundamental principles. When he is adhering
strictly to his own technical terminology, Aristotle calls our grasp of them not ``knowledge''
(totl) but voiOg, ``intuition'' or however else we choose to translate this elusive term.
Knowledge or etotrp, most properly so called, is confined to derivative truths, which one
must grasp as consequences of the first principles by which they are necessitated and explained
if one is to know them in this favored sense. According to Aristotle, this condition consists in
the grasp of an argument or syllogism of a special kind, viz., a demonstration, which in turn
is defined as a syllogism by grasping which we know (Nicomachean Ethics 6.3, 1139b31-2;
Analytica posteriora 1.2, 71b18).
Consider a favorite example of his: the demonstration that the planets do not twinkle
(Analytica posteriora 1.13, 78a30-b4). Not-twinkling belongs to all that is near, nearness
belongs to the planets; therefore the planets do not twinkle. Those familiar with Aristotelian
logic will recognize this as a categorical syllogism in the first figure mood, Barbara. A crucial
feature of a demonstration, according to Aristotle, is that the so-called middle term, in this
case nearness, state the cause or explanation. It is because the planets are near that they do not
twinkle, and it is, therefore, by grasping this syllogism that one understands why the planets
do not twinkle at the same time as one grasps that they do not.
But suppose, says Aristotle, that the premise stating that not-twinkling belongs to all that
is near converts, that is, not only does not-twinkling belong to everything that is near but near-
ness belongs to everything that does not twinkle. In these conditions, it is possible to construct
an argument, also a syllogism in Barbara, that deduces the conclusion that the planets are near,
