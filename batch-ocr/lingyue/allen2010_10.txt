order to communicate their thoughts to each other (Letter to Herodotus 75-76; cf. Lucretius,
De rerum natura 5.1056-90).'
Our attempts to understand Epicurean views about sign inference have been greatly as-
sisted by the survival, in the form of a papyrus buried at Herculaneum by the eruption of
Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79, of a work by the first-century B.C. poet and Epicurean philosopher
Philodemus: On Signs and Sign-inferences (the De signis for short).'' Among the problems
presented by what we find in it is one that has to do with the distinction between the empiri-
cal and the rational, or rather its apparent absence. As we have already seen, the Epicurean
position would seem at first to be a paradigmatic example of rationalist thought. According
to empiricism, knowledge is confined to the phenomena, which are accessible to perception,
and the patterns of conjunction and sequence that are observed to obtain among them and does
not extend to so-called non-evident matters.
A very large part, perhaps the largest part, of Epicurus and his followers' energies were
occupied with natural philosophy. Their motives were idiosyncratic to be sure, namely, by
offering a purely naturalistic account of nature and natural phenomena to remove divine
agency from the picture and so free human beings from superstition, which was in their-
the Epicureans' - view the principal obstacle to happiness. To this end, Epicurus elaborated
an atomic theory of matter and offered explanations for natural phenomena, paying special
attention to heavenly phenomena.
To show how we could in fact know the contents of his theory, he also developed an
epistemology. This theory seems to fit very comfortably in Sextus' epistemological frame-
work. Direct observation of the phenomena secures ground-level truths, which in turn serve
as points of departure for sign-inferences and demonstrations by means of which truths about
the non-evident realm are won, whether about atoms, rendered inaccessible to perception by
their smallness or heavenly bodies, put beyond the reach of observation by their distance from
us (Epicurus, Letter to Herodotus 38, 39; Letter to Pythocles 87, 97, 104; Diogenes Laertius
10.32). It looks very much as if the Epicureans are to be classified as rationalists who sub-
scribed to a theory of indicative signs, as Sextus conceived it, even if they did not describe
themselves in this way or use the term ``indicative sign'' itself (and those who did held a view
in some ways different from what Sextus leads us to expect).
To judge by Philodemus' testimony and hints from other Epicurean works, however, this
expectation was not fulfilled. We search in vain for the contrast that defined the controversy
between rationalism and empiricism. The position that we find instead appears to occupy
a no-man's land that should not exist according to the framework of assumptions in terms
of which rationalists and empiricists defined their opposition to each other. The medical
Empiricists define experience as knowledge of what has been observed to occur in the same
way many times. That a ring around the moon precedes rain or that venesection is followed
by the remission of fever become part of experience by being observed repeatedly. No amount
of observation, however, can make these anything other than empirical generalizations by
grasping which we know that without being any closer to understanding the underlying causes
and natures because of which things are as they are observed to be and in terms of which a
genuine explanation of why they are would have to be formulated. One important consequence
is that the so-called transition to the similar whereby we take things similar to those of which
we have had experience to be similar to them cannot be a source of new knowledge by itself,
