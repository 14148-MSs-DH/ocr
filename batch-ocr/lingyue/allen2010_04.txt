one of the premises of the demonstration above, from the converted proposition, everything
that does not twinkle is near, together with the fact, which can be established by observation,
that the planets do not twinkle. Though the argument is no less valid and its premises and
conclusion no less true, it is not a demonstration, strictly speaking, since the conclusion is not
explained by the premises. The middle term, not-twinkling in this case, is not the cause; that
is, it is not because the planets do not twinkle that they are near, though it is because they do
not twinkle that, when guided by this argument, we are justified in concluding that they are
near. In old-fashioned terms, not twinkling is the ratio cognoscendi not the ratio essendi,'
But though not the cause, not-twinkling is evidence for the nearness of the planets or,
alternatively, a sign of their being near. Elsewhere Aristotle gives examples of pairs of syl-
logisms that share a conclusion, one of which is a demonstration, the other an inference from
signs. For example, when the moon is eclipsed this can be demonstrated from the fact that it
is undergoing interposition by the earth, which is the cause of the eclipse (Analytica poste-
riora 2.8, 93a36ff.). The same conclusion can also be deduced from the fact that the moon is
unable to produce a shadow despite being full. But the latter, namely being unable to produce
a shadow, is not the cause of the moon being eclipsed, but merely a sign of it.
Thus in Aristotle's hands talk of signs often signals a contrast between inferences that
put us in a position to know the that and inferences that lay bare the causes thereby enabling
us to understand the why. Signs are, if you will, mere evidence. Indeed the few remarks that
Aristotle devotes explicitly to sign-inference are in passages concerned with forms of argu-
ment that are most prominent in rhetoric, where the object is not a deeper understanding of
the kind sought in the sciences, but the simple establishing of the facts (Analytica priora 2.27;
Rhetorica 1.2, 1357a33ff.; 2.25, 1402b12ff.).'
Two observations should be made before we proceed. First, some ancient philosophers,
especially but not only the pre-Socratics, were happy to speak of signs in connection with
inferences by means of which the sciences are constituted and an understanding of the ultimate
causes at work in nature secured (if not quite in the Aristotelian way). This seems often to
coincide with a tendency not to draw the kind of distinctions between types of inference and
types of ground that we have been considering, or at least not to assign it a place of such cen-
tral importance. Epicurus is an example, about whom I shall have more to say soon. Second,
for those who do make the distinction, experience (cetpi, experientia) is an especially
fruitful source of sign-inferences of the less exalted sort.
Since at least the time of Plato and Aristotle, experience was conceived in something
like the following way. It arises out of repeated episodes of perception and is confined to the
objects that fall under perception, which are, if you will, inferentially brute or discrete: by
themselves and as such, they imply nothing substantively different from their own existence.
Nevertheless, observation of recurring patterns of sequence and conjunction among such ob-
jects furnishes us with a stock of empirical generalizations, which are of great value not least
in supporting sign-inferences like that from smoke to fire.
