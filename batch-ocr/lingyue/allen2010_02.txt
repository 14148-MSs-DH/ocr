that signify, that is, words, and what they signify or mean (Diogenes Laertius 7.62). And a
good deal later, Saint Augustine (A.D. 354-430), who has much to say about signs, will treat
scripture as a system of divinely given signs.
Yet another use of ``sign'' is at least as common. ``Smoke is a sign of fire.'' ``Tracks of this
kind are a sign that a leopard has passed this way.'' ``The fact that there is a ring around the
moon is a sign that it will rain tomorrow.'' In cases like these there is, it seems, no question of
anyone meaning something by the signs at issue. They serve, instead, as evidence or grounds
for a conclusion - and this appears to be a very different thing indeed. Yet here too, even
in the absence of someone who means something, we still speak of meaning. ``The fact that
there is a ring around the moon means that it will rain tomorrow,'' ``Smoke means fire,'' and
so on. These facts are the basis of the distinction between natural and non-natural meaning
drawn in a celebrated article by H. P. Grice, who was himself looking back to a distinction
of Saint Augustine's between natural and given signs (signa naturalia, signa data). Very
roughly speaking, natural meaning, which belongs to natural signs as such, is the evidential
support that a sign furnishes for a conclusion, while given signs are used by humans, or be-
ings relevantly like them, in order to convey their thoughts to other such beings, where it is
somehow essential if this task is to be effected that the recipient grasp that this is the intention
of the sign's user.'
The fact that the word ``meaning,'' with its very different history, also extends across
the divide separating the natural from the non-natural or given divide suggests that it is not
an accident that the same term ``sign'' comes to be used of these very different cases. They
have, and were felt to have, something important in common. Thus according to Augustine,
``a sign is something that brings it about by itself that something apart from the impression it
makes on the senses comes to mind'' (De doctrina christiana 2.1. 1). We shall come back to
the distinction between natural and given signs, which is one of those that I mean to suggest
comes under strain.
For the present, however, I shall concentrate on the natural side of the divide. A (natural)
sign furnishes evidence: when all goes well, we come to know something distinct from it by
inferring a conclusion from it. To discharge this function, it is not enough that the sign furnish
grounds for the conclusion at issue, it must be better or more easily known than it, either in
general or on the occasion of its use as a sign. This condition is enshrined in the requirement
that a sign be revelatory, which is part of the Stoic definition of the sign as ``a true antecedent
in a sound conditional revelatory of the consequent.''? So, for example, though the fact that
