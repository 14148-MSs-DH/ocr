GREEK PHILOSOPHY AND SIGNS
mathematicos 8. 199-481).' But the Stoics seem to have supposed that we are in a position to
grasp the causes far less often than many rationalists supposed. Thus Chrysippus (ca. 280-207
B.C.), the third scholarch of the Stoa and the philosopher most responsible for working out the
orthodox Stoic position in detail, urges us to rely on experience and history - terms that figure
prominently in the Empiricists' own self-description - in those all too frequent cases where
causal speculation is likely to lead us into error (Plutarch, De Stoicorum repugnantiis 1047c).
And Posidonius (ca. 135-50 B.C.), the most prominent Stoic of his time, could be faulted by
other Stoics for aetiologizing in the Aristotelian manner rather than preserving a more authenti-
cally Stoic reserve before the hiddeness (ripwg) of the causes (Strabo 2.3.8).
As it happens, there is a Stoic discipline occupied with signs whose method was in good
part empirical, namely divination, about which we know a good deal owing to Cicero's inter-
est (106-43 B.C.). He tackled the subject in his work De divinatione where, proceeding as
an Academic skeptic, he expounds the Stoic view before undertaking to refute it.P In a way
that should sound very familiar by now, he distinguishes knowledge that, which is obtained
through signs, from knowledge of causes, which, to be sure, when complete, would make it
possible to know the future in every particular, but which, in this form, is available only to a
god (De divinatione 1.127; cf. 12, 16, 29, 35, 86, 109). Much of the time, then, human beings
are obliged to fall back on signs.
They are greatly helped by the fact that the signs in question were fashioned by divine
providence for the benefit of humankind. According the Stoics, divination is the power to
grasp and interpret the signs sent by Gods to human beings (De divinatione 2.130; Sextus
Empiricus, Adversus mathematicos 9. 132; Stobaeus, Ekologai 2.170). It has two parts, artifi-
cial and natural. The former is so-called because the signs with which it is occupied require
specialized expertise to interpret, while the natural division relies on things like inspired ut-
terances and dreams which do not (though there are, unsurprisingly, complications having to
do with the skilled interpretation that dreams and prophetic utterances do sometimes require).
Though artificial divination is also concerned with the interpretation of portents, much the
largest share of its attention is absorbed by signs discovered by long observation, whose ef-
ficacy is explained along empirical lines and illustrated with examples drawn from medicine,
viewed as an empirical art, and other arts viewed in the same way.
Nor do I ask why this tree alone should flower three times nor why it makes the time
for ploughing fit with the sign of its flowering. I am content with this, that, even
though I do not know why this happens, I do know what happens. So for every kind
of divination I shall give the same answer as I did for the things I have cited. I see
the efficacy of the scammony root for purging and birthwort for countering snake
bites ... and this is sufficient; I do not know why they work. In the same way I do not
understand adequately the explanation for the signs of wind and rain.... I recognize,
I know, and I vouch for the force and result of them (De divinatione 1.16; translation
from Wardle 2006: 50).
Thus the Stoics came down squarely on the empirical side of a long-running debate about
divination especially prominent in discussions of astrology. At issue was the question whether
its efficacy is to be explained as the result of discovering the causal influences exerted on hu-
man beings and their affairs by heavenly bodies or rather merely a matter of grasping empirical
correlations the causes responsible for which remain hidden.'
