GREEK PHILOSOPHY AND SIGNS
- witness the Stoic definition of divination - though it is an intriguing question whether the
regularities on which empirical arts of a less elevated kind rely are also deliberately contrived
by divine agency for the benefit of humankind. Certainly Stoic views about providence are not
incompatible with the suggestion. Yet there are some differences. The more ordinary empirical
arts, or arts with a substantial empirical component, are only at one remove from a grasp of
the nature of the matters with which they deal and the causes at work in them, whereas such
an understanding may be in principle impossible for human beings in the sphere of divina-
tion. The divine intentions behind the regularities studied and exploited by, for example, the
medical art are, one suspects, no business of the doctor as such. It is plausible to think that
the perspective proper to medicine and other arts like it is a naturalistic one, even though
to the Stoic way of thinking, this is a narrow or restricted way of viewing matters that can
be subsumed in a broader perspective from which nature is seen as the expression of divine
reason, indeed, in a sense, identical to it.
If this suggestion is on the right lines, the distinction between the natural and the non-
natural does gain a purchase in Stoicism. Not only can there be analogues of indicative sig-
nification, which do not raise the question that we have been considering - the conclusion
of the sign-inference will be accepted on the strength of the rationally compelling grounds
afforded by the sign, but the presumably much larger mass of signs grasped through long
observation can be understood along purely empirical lines. What is more, they will be so un-
derstood much of the time and by human beings reasoning in most capacities. What is striking
and distinctive about the Stoics, however, is that one branch of divination as they conceive it
is both an impeccably rigorous application of empirical method and a means of interpreting
divinely given signals. Understood in one way and viewed from one perspective, the signs
with which it is occupied are or are used as natural signs. Viewed in broader perspective,
however, the empirically grounded sign-inferences that the diviner draws are not natural in
a way that can be sharply contrasted with the non-natural. For they are not only the product
of divine intentions, but of intentions whose divine author intends that they be recognized,
at least by diviners, whose other tasks, it will be recalled, include interpreting other kinds of
message from the gods, for example, portents.
Matters are otherwise when we turn to the Epicureans, whose views about the gods could
hardly be more different from the Stoa's. The gods of Epicurus, such as they are, did not cre-
ate the world, exert no influence on it, and could not care less about human beings. Nothing
in the world observed by human beings is the product of divine intention, and there is, as a
result, a clean break between natural signs and the signs human beings create and give to one
another, even if the lEpicureans do not themselves speak of ``signs'' in this connection. The
break stands out that much more clearly as, in the Epicurean view, the development of the
latter depends on the prior existence of the former. Epicurus' pioneering account of the origin
of speech and language envisages a transition from an early phase in which human beings'
spontaneous vocal utterances serve as what we would call natural signs of their mental states
and emotions, to later phases where the possibility of conveying information that is revealed
in this way is deliberately exploited by human beings, who now fashion and use words in
